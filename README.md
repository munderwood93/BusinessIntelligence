## Power BI
Created a Power BI report using Power BI Desktop to showcase my job history. To view my report, navigate to my Power BI subrepo and download my Excel datafile, titled "BusinessIntelligence.xlsx", and my PBIX file, titled "MatthewUnderwoodResumeBI.pbix". You can then open my PBIX file using Power BI Desktop.
